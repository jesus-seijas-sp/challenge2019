During your expedition to the Mountain of Madness, the Great Race of Yith gets your mind travelling in time to the past into a Yithian body.
Now you want to return to your time, and one Yithian tries to help you. Unfortunatelly, you don't understand a so different body, and the first issue that you notice is that you don't hear his words... instead you see different colors.
